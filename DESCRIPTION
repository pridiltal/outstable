Description: This work develops a framework for detecting 
    anomalies in tidy time series data. An anomaly is defined 
    as an observation that is predicted as very unlikely given 
    the robust time series forecast models. The algorithm works
    with tidy temporal data provided by the tsibble package and 
    produces an outstable, a tsibble with flagged anomalies and 
    their degree of outlierness. An approach based on extreme value
    theory is applied to residual series in order to calculate 
    a data-driven anomalous threshold. The proposed framework can also
    provide a cleansed tsibble that closely integrates with the tidy 
    forecasting workflow used in the fable package. A number of different 
    approaches are available for the data cleansing process.
