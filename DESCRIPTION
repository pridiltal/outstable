Description: This work develops a framework for detecting anomalies in
    tidy time series data. An anomaly is defined as an observation that is
    predicted as very unlikely given the robust time series forecast
    models. The algorithm works with tidy temporal data provided by the
    tsibble package and produces an outstable, a tsibble with flagged
    anomalies and their degree of outlierness. An approach based on
    extreme value theory is applied to residual series in order to
    calculate a data-driven anomalous threshold. The proposed framework
    can also provide a cleansed tsibble that closely integrates with the
    tidy forecasting workflow used in the fable package. A number of
    different approaches are available for the data cleansing process.
